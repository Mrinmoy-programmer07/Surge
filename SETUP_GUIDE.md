## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Backend Oracle Wallet

You need a **second wallet** for your backend to submit scores. Here are your options:

#### Option A: Use Your Deployer Wallet (Quick & Easy - For Testing)

Just use the same address for both deployer and backend oracle:

```env
# In contracts/.env
PRIVATE_KEY=0xf2ef47fe31d504c57de56b6417856fcd565e9f2befee4f331f4e9f03d4cfb0c1
BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_FROM_METAMASK

# In root .env.local
BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY=0xf2ef47fe31d504c57de56b6417856fcd565e9f2befee4f331f4e9f03d4cfb0c1
```

**How to find your wallet address:**

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click on your account name at top
3. Copy the address (starts with 0x...)
4. Use that as BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS

#### Option B: Create Separate Backend Wallet (Recommended for Production)

Run this command to generate a new wallet:

```bash
cd contracts
node generate-backend-wallet.js
```

This will output:

```
ADDRESS: 0x... (use for BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS)
PRIVATE KEY: 0x... (use for BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

---

### Step 2: Create Configuration Files

#### File 1: `contracts/.env.local`

Create this file with:

```env
# Deployment wallet
PRIVATE_KEY=0xf2ef47fe31d504c57de56b6417856fcd565e9f2befee4f331f4e9f03d4cfb0c1

# Backend oracle (your wallet address from MetaMask)
BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0xYOUR_ADDRESS_HERE

# Celoscan verification
CELOSCAN_API_KEY=AUI6Y6U4E7DHQK8JH4GM3S4RX8MBWATGWZ

# Network RPC (already configured)
CELO_SEPOLIA_RPC=http://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org
CELO_MAINNET_RPC=https://forno.celo.org
```

#### File 2: `.env.local` (in root directory)

Create this file with:

```env
# Smart contract address (add after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SURGE_GAMING_CONTRACT=

# Backend wallet private key (same as deployer for testing)
BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY=0xf2ef47fe31d504c57de56b6417856fcd565e9f2befee4f331f4e9f03d4cfb0c1

# Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=sepolia
```

---

### Step 3: Get Testnet CELO

1. Go to: https://faucet.celo.org/sepolia
2. Enter your wallet address (from MetaMask)
3. Request testnet CELO
4. Wait for confirmation

You need:

- **Deployer wallet**: ~0.5 CELO (for deployment gas)
- **Backend wallet**: ~0.1 CELO (for submitting scores)

---

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

---

### Step 5: Compile Contract

```bash
npm run compile
```

Expected output:

```
Compiled 1 Solidity file successfully
```

---

### Step 6: Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Expected output:

```
  SurgeGaming
    ‚úì Should create a match with correct stake
    ‚úì Should allow player2 to join with matching stake
    ... (more tests)

  8 passing
```

---

### Step 7: Deploy to Sepolia Testnet

```bash
npm run deploy:testnet
```

Expected output:

```
üöÄ Deploying SurgeGaming contract...

üìù Deploying with account: 0x...
üí∞ Account balance: ...

‚úÖ SurgeGaming deployed to: 0xABCD1234...
üè¶ Platform Wallet: 0xC0Aa6fb8641c2b014d86112dB098AAb17bcc9b13
üíµ Min Stake: 100000000000000000
‚è±Ô∏è  Timeout: 300 seconds

üîç Verifying contract on Celoscan...
‚úÖ Contract verified!
```

**SAVE THE CONTRACT ADDRESS!**

---

### Step 8: Update .env.local

Add the contract address you just got:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SURGE_GAMING_CONTRACT=0xYOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY=0xf2ef47fe31d504c57de56b6417856fcd565e9f2befee4f331f4e9f03d4cfb0c1
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=sepolia
```

---

### Step 9: Start Development Server

```bash
# In root directory
pnpm dev
```

---

### Step 10: Test End-to-End

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Connect MetaMask (make sure you're on Celo Sepolia testnet)
3. Create a match with 0.5 CELO
4. Use a second wallet to join
5. Play the game
6. Winner withdraws

### Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd contracts && npm install

# Compile contract
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **NEVER commit .env or .env.local to git!**
2. **Keep your private keys secret!**
3. **Use testnet first, test thoroughly**
4. **Get testnet CELO before deploying**
5. **Save your contract address after deployment**

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"

- Get more testnet CELO from faucet

### "Invalid backend oracle"

- Check BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS is a valid address (starts with 0x)

### "Contract already exists"

- Contract already deployed, check Celoscan

### "Network not supported"

- Make sure MetaMask is on Celo Sepolia network
