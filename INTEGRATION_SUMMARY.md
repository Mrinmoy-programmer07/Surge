## 🔧 What The Smart Contract Does

### Core Features

✅ **Match Creation & Joining**

- Players deposit CELO to create/join matches
- Funds locked in secure escrow
- Minimum stake: 0.1 CELO

✅ **Score Management**

- Backend oracle submits scores
- Prevents client-side cheating
- Automatic winner calculation

✅ **Payouts**

- Winner: 75% of pot (1.5 CELO for 1 CELO stake)
- Platform: 25% fee (0.5 CELO)
- Draw: Full refund, no fees

✅ **Security**

- ReentrancyGuard prevents double-spending
- Pausable for emergencies
- Timeout protection
- Double withdrawal prevention

✅ **On-Chain Stats**

- Wins, losses tracked per player
- Total earnings recorded
- Total staked tracked

## 🎮 How It Works

### Match Flow

```
1. Player 1: createMatch(matchId) + 1 CELO
   └─> Contract holds 1 CELO in escrow

2. Player 2: joinMatch(matchId) + 1 CELO
   └─> Contract holds 2 CELO total

3. Both players play game on frontend

4. Backend: submitScore(matchId, player1, score1)
   └─> Contract records player 1 score

5. Backend: submitScore(matchId, player2, score2)
   └─> Contract records player 2 score

6. Backend: declareWinner(matchId, winnerAddress)
   └─> Contract calculates payouts
       ├─> Winner payout: 1.5 CELO (75%)
       └─> Platform fee: 0.5 CELO (25%)

7. Winner: withdraw(matchId)
   └─> Contract sends 1.5 CELO to winner

8. Platform: withdrawPlatformFees()
   └─> Platform collects accumulated 0.5 CELO
```

## 📊 Economic Model

| Stake/Player | Total Pot | Winner | Platform | Loser |
| ------------ | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| 0.5 CELO     | 1 CELO    | 0.75   | 0.25     | 0     |
| 1 CELO       | 2 CELO    | 1.5    | 0.5      | 0     |
| 2 CELO       | 4 CELO    | 3      | 1        | 0     |
| 5 CELO       | 10 CELO   | 7.5    | 2.5      | 0     |

**Draw**: Both players get full refund, 0 platform fee

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
BACKEND_ORACLE_ADDRESS=your_backend_wallet_address
CELOSCAN_API_KEY=your_celoscan_key
```

### 3. Test Contract

```bash
npm test
```

### 4. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Get testnet CELO from https://faucet.celo.org
npm run deploy:testnet
```

### 5. Update Frontend Config

```bash
# In root .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SURGE_GAMING_CONTRACT=0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_BACKEND_WALLET_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=alfajores
```

### 6. Test End-to-End

1. Connect two wallets
2. Create match (deposit 0.5 CELO)
3. Join match (deposit 0.5 CELO)
4. Play game
5. Winner withdraws 0.75 CELO
6. Platform collects 0.25 CELO

## 🧪 Testing

The contract includes comprehensive tests:

```javascript
✓ Should create a match with correct stake
✓ Should allow player2 to join with matching stake
✓ Should reject mismatched stake
✓ Should allow backend to submit scores
✓ Should reject score submission from non-backend
✓ Should allow winner to withdraw 75% of pot
✓ Should prevent double withdrawal
✓ Should accumulate platform fees
✓ Should refund both players on draw
```
